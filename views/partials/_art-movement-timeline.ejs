            <p class="art-movement-description">Between approximately 5000 BC and 300 AD, “advanced” civilizations (generally, those with written language) thrived in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Sumeria, Akkadia, Mexico, Rome, Japan, China, and India. Art played an important role in these growing societies by providing a means to enforce religious and political order. For example, the art of ancient Egypt includes symbolic imagery alongside text (hieroglyphs) that tells stories and exalts rulers, gods, and goddesses. Although prehistoric humans made art as far back as 40,000 years ago, ancient art is considered by some to be the foundation of all of art history, with its techniques, forms, and subject matter continuing to inform the art of today.

During this period, artistic objects were commissioned by wealthy oligarchs or powerful church leaders for specific social and religious rituals.

            <p class="art-movement-description">A term encompassing the wide variety of art and architecture produced during the Middle Ages, a prolonged period of economic and social stagnation in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean that spanned roughly from the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD to the early stages of the Renaissance (1400s). Though art historians debate the specific stylistic and chronological divisions of the Medieval, a generally-accepted sequence identifies the following periods: Early Medieval Art, Romanesque Art, and Gothic Art.

While it initially referred to the architectural style developed between the 11th and mid-12th centuries in Western Europe, Romanesque has recently been extended to include other areas of artistic production, including sculpture and painting. Major characteristics of Romanesque art exist in churches or monasteries and include vaulted ceilings and rounded or pointed arches. Romanesque sculptural decoration comes in the form of figurative capitals atop dense columns or in bronze reliefs carved into doors and tympanums over entryways.

The political and economic development from feudal states to cohesive city-states, and the rise of powerful patrons that followed, allowed artists like Duccio, Giotto, Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, and Tomaso da Modena to focus on secular portraiture and sculpture.

            <p class="art-movement-description">Spanning the late 15th and early 16th centuries in Italy, the High Renaissance is often acknowledged as the height of artistic achievement in post-medieval Europe. Culminating during a prolonged cultural awakening and marked by the pursuit of humanist ideals like naturalism, proportion, and Classical bodily forms in painting, sculpture, and architecture, the High Renaissance also encompassed the careers of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo. Da Vinci emerged as the most influential artist and thinker of the time (and perhaps in the history of Western art). The legacy of the High Renaissance is primarily seen through the continued use of da Vinci’s innovative approaches to artmaking, such as freehand sketching and subtle tonal gradation (also known as sfumato).

It was characterized by pastel colors, sinuous curves, and asymmetrical patterns based on flowers, vines, corals and seashells. Reacting against the Baroque style, Rococo artists favored more intimate mythological scenes, idyllic pastoral imagery, and lighthearted depictions of pleasure-seeking. Although rejected by the Neoclassicists, the style enjoyed periods of renewed interest, such as during Rococo Revival in the mid-19th century.

The structured approach to historical subject matter in Neoclassical work was seen as the opposite of the ornamentation of the preceding Rococo movement. Concurrently with, and in the face of, Neoclassicism, Romanticism was also emerging.

Arising in Germany, England, and France, and opposing the rationalism and order of the church, state, Enlightenment thought, and Neoclassical art, Romanticism was associated with some of the best known Western artists of the 19th century, including Théodore Géricualt, Eugène Delacroix, Francisco de Goya, J.M.W. Turner, and John Constable. The unpredictability, sublime power and chaos of nature were a common subject for Romantic works, as were exotic experiences in regions like what was called “The Orient” (the East) and North Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria.

Beginning in France in the 1840s, Realism revolutionized painting, expanding conceptions of what constituted art. Working in a chaotic era marked by revolution and widespread social change, Realist painters replaced the idealistic images and literary conceits of traditional art with real-life events, giving the margins of society similar weight to grand history paintings and allegories.

Striving to capture the transient aspects of visual reality, especially light and color, Impressionists--the most familiar being [Claude Monet](/artist/claude-monet) and [Pierre Auguste Renoir](/artist/pierre-auguste-renoir)--emphasized firsthand observation of their subjects and focused on landscapes and everyday urban scenes. Like many subsequent avant-garde movements, it derived its name from a derisive label applied in a negative review. Impressionism spread beyond France, most notably to Great Britain and the United States.

Expressionist art was often characterized by spontaneous brushwork or mark-making, distorted figures, a progression towards abstraction, and a concentration on forms and ideas borrowed from myths and so-called “primitive art.” In reaction to the shock of urbanization and the machine age, many of these artists attempted to convey psychological states of isolation and alienation, or sought refuge in the idea of a spiritual art. In Vienna, Egon Schiele created unsettling, sinuous portraits that evoked the anxiety of the age; in Germany, the formal experiments of Wassily Kandinsky combined new forms and color combinations with a focus on mysticism and expression.

            <p class="art-movement-description">Cubism was the most important movement of the 20th century and marked the birth of abstract art. Invented and pursued by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in Paris between 1907 and 1914 and inspired by the simplified landscapes of Paul Cézanne, Cubism took the revolutionary step of rejecting the 500-year-old idea that a painting was like a window, thus ruled by perspective. Instead, Picasso and Braque created more conceptual, subjective paintings that sought to represent the underlying structure of existence. The best-known Cubist works look like shattered glass in dim browns and yellows, and are composed of various sharp planes that combine to form people or objects. Cubism took its name from an insult delivered by the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who commented that one of Braque’s paintings looked as if it were “full of little cubes.”

            <p class="art-movement-description">Futurism began with the 1909 publication of F.T. Marinetti’s Futurist Manifesto, which announced a new literature that would glorify danger, energy, and war. While best known for a dynamic style in painting and sculpture that captured speed and movement as if in time-lapse, Futurist artists created “total works of art” (performance, installation, fashion, and more). Though many leading Futurists died in World War I, a “second Futurism” followed, which allied itself with the fascist politics of Mussolini.

            <p class="art-movement-description">While abstraction is evident around the world in art and functional objects, its art-historical significance is as a category for 20th-century Western art that moved away from the faithful representation of nature. The origins of abstraction are commonly located in the works of J.M.W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, the Impressionists, as well as in the early 1900s, when Paul Cézanne's stylized, flattened forms influenced what would eventually be called the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Arguably the first abstract art movement, Cubism would prove foundational to countless branches of abstract art, including Futurism in Italy, the non-objective abstraction of Wassily Kandinsky, Kasimir Malevich, and Piet Mondrian, and the Purism of Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant.

            <p class="art-movement-description">A movement originating in Zurich in 1916 as a reaction both to the chaos of Western society in the wake of World War I and to bourgeois society, which was seen as having produced the war. It is characterized by the rejection of old forms of artmaking in favor of an anti-art that asserts art’s irrelevance and explores new forms of creation. Dadaists are usually divided into two camps: those creating from anger and frustration and those embracing the absurd. Prominent adherents include Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp, both of whom sought in their work to destabilize artistic dogmas, particularly traditional formal strategies and concepts of artistic meaning. From Zurich, Dada spread across Europe—most notably the German cities of Berlin, Cologne, and Hannover—and eventually into the United States, particularly New York City.

            <p class="art-movement-description">A term coined in 1927 by MoMA’s first director Alfred H. Barr Jr. to describe American artists of the 1920s who depicted American architecture, industry, and landscapes in highly precise but simplified lines and forms. Although influenced by Cubism and its various European offshoots (such as Futurism and Purism), the Precisionists were distinctly American in their focus on regional imagery like skyscrapers, suspension bridges, and mills. Some of the best-known artists understood as Precisionist are Charles Sheeler, Charles Demuth, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Historically, the Precisionists' emphasis on American building projects and industry has been seen as a reflection of 1920s and ‘30s American isolationism and consequently, the country’s desire to define its unique national identity.

            <p class="art-movement-description">A movement embracing the irrational as a means of creating art and experiencing life, whose founding document is the Surrealist Manifesto composed by André Breton in 1924. Taking pure psychic automatism as the ideal state of man, Surrealists believed that one could express the true functioning of thought in the unconscious. Initially, the most important aspect of the unconscious was desire, which they felt was central to humanity—the authentic voice of the inner self and the key to understanding human beings. Dreams, childhood, madness, non-Western art, and chance situations became central to discovering the irrational in Surrealist art.

Practitioners sought to break with the past, creating a style of ornamentation applicable to architecture, interior design, and objects that was not based on Classical or Renaissance forms. Instead Japanese art was a particular influence, as were exotic flowers and plants.

            <p class="art-movement-description">Pop Art was the dominant movement in early 1960s American art. Short for “popular art,” it featured common household objects and consumer products like Coca-Cola and Campbell’s Soup cans, as well as forms of media—such as comics, newspapers, and magazines—recognizable to the masses. Artists often created Pop works using mechanical or commercial techniques, such as silk-screening. As Warhol suggested, the choice of mundane subject matter and machine-like techniques was a blunt rejection of the heroic subjects and methods of Abstract Expressionism, the leading American movement of the 1950s. Not often discussed is the fact that Pop Art originated in England and paralleled similar movements in France and Germany. Pop Art was incredibly diverse, especially in its international variants, which included Nouveau Réalisme in France, Capitalist Realism in Germany, and Anti-Art in Japan.

            <p class="art-movement-description">Though it has come to refer generally to painting that emulates the look of photographs, typically with hyperrealistic clarity, the term "photorealistic" traces its roots to Photorealism, the American art movement of the 1960s and ’70s. An outgrowth of Pop Art, Photorealism is most closely associated with artists who replicate the highly-focused look of well-composed, sharply-focused photographs, such as Chuck Close, Richard Estes, and Malcolm Morley. However, in Europe, artists like Gerhard Richter and Franz Gertsch have likewise been referred to as photorealists, but for a different reason: the hazy quality and unexpected angles in their candid portraits resemble casual, often blurred snapshots. Today, artists who emulate the look of photographs make work in both ways (and in between), and as a result, push the boundaries of what constitutes a photorealistic image.

            <img class="art-movement-image" src="images/land_art.png">
            <p class="art-movement-description">A shortening of the phrase "landscape art,” used interchangeably with Earthworks to refer to pieces made of materials derived from the earth or situated on or within a landscape. Such works are usually site specific—created for and utilizing aspects or characteristics of a particular location. Both American and European artists began to use dirt, rocks, and sand as media and subject matter in the late 1960s, experimenting with diverse approaches. In 1967 the English artist Richard Long walked up and down a stretch of meadow over and over, creating a visible path depicted in the photograph A Line Made by Walking. This understated meditation on the symmetry and grace of a simple landscape contrasts with Land Art works that seek to dramatically alter a site, such as Robert Smithson’s well-known 1970 sculpture and film, Spiral Jetty, which uses 7,000 tons of basalt, boulders, mud, and salt crystals mined from the area around Rozel Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, to form a massive spiral winding 450 meters from the lake shore. Some of these works address ecological issues like those concerning activists in the 1960s. Alan Sonfist’s Time Landscape, for instance, which he proposed in 1965 and implemented in 1978, re-creates the original landscape on a small plot in Manhattan, calling attention to what is lost through urbanization and development.
