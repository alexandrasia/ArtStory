              <p class="art-movement-description">Between approximately 5000 BC and 300 AD, “advanced” civilizations (generally, those with written language) thrived in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Sumeria, Akkadia, Mexico, Rome, Japan, China, and India. Art played an important role in these growing societies by providing a means to enforce religious and political order. For example, one of the most famous artworks from ancient Mesopotamia, often called the “cradle of civilization,” is the Code of Hammurabi, a set of laws carved in stone and adorned by an image of King Hammurabi and the Mesopotamian god Shabash. Similarly, the art of ancient Egypt includes symbolic imagery alongside text (hieroglyphs) that tells stories and exalts rulers, gods, and goddesses. Although prehistoric humans made art as far back as 40,000 years ago, ancient art is considered by some to be the foundation of all of art history, with its techniques, forms, and subject matter continuing to inform the art of today.</p>

Romanesque sculptural decoration comes in the form of figurative capitals atop dense columns or in bronze reliefs carved into doors and tympanums over entryways.</p>

The term refers to the renewed effort of artists to achieve exact representations of nature and idealized forms of the human body, which radically departed from the appearance of art and architecture of the preceding Middle Ages. While the [Early Renaissance](/gene/early-renaissance) period in Italy drew from Byzantine aesthetics, the [High Renaissance](/gene/high-renaissance) returned to forms from classical antiquity. This shift was due in part to the development of oil paint in Netherlandish regions and the growing trade of information throughout Europe. In addition to new painting techniques, artists turned toward other areas of study, such as the sciences (which, as a result, also experienced a renewed enthusiasm) and scientific ideas regarding perspective.</p>

Da Vinci emerged as the most influential artist and thinker of the time (and perhaps in the history of Western art). The legacy of the High Renaissance is primarily seen through the continued use of da Vinci’s innovative approaches to artmaking, such as freehand sketching and subtle tonal gradation (also known as sfumato).</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">Derived from the French word rocaille (meaning “rock-work”) and Italian borocco (“Baroque”), Rococo was a highly ornamented and florid style popular in 18th-century Europe, especially in France. It was characterized by pastel colors, sinuous curves, and asymmetrical patterns based on flowers, vines, corals and seashells. Reacting against the Baroque style, Rococo artists favored more intimate mythological scenes, idyllic pastoral imagery, and lighthearted depictions of pleasure-seeking. Although rejected by the Neoclassicists, the style enjoyed periods of renewed interest, such as during Rococo Revival in the mid-19th century.</p>

Archaeological discoveries of the time brought the work of these ancient civilizations to the attention of Neoclassicists. The structured approach to historical subject matter in Neoclassical work was seen as the opposite of the ornamentation of the preceding Rococo movement. Concurrently with, and in the face of, Neoclassicism, Romanticism was also emerging. Jacques-Louis David is the best-known Neoclassical artist; two of his most famous works are Oath of the Horatii (1784) and Death of Marat (1793).</p>

            <p class="art-movement-description">An artistic movement with its origins in literature, Romanticism was prominent in Western European art from roughly 1800-1850, embracing emotional intensity, subjectivity, and the imagination. Arising in Germany, England, and France, and opposing the rationalism and order of the church, state, Enlightenment thought, and Neoclassical art, Romanticism was associated with some of the best known Western artists of the 19th century, including Théodore Géricualt, Eugène Delacroix, Francisco de Goya, J.M.W. Turner, and John Constable. The unpredictability, sublime power and chaos of nature were a common subject for Romantic works, as were exotic experiences in regions like what was called “The Orient” (the East) and North Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria. Many of what we consider to be the major aspects of modern and contemporary art—including personal, emotional subjects, and the individuality of the artist—find their beginnings in Romanticism.</p>

Striving to capture the transient aspects of visual reality, especially light and color, Impressionists--the most familiar being [Claude Monet](/artist/claude-monet) and [Pierre Auguste Renoir](/artist/pierre-auguste-renoir)--emphasized firsthand observation of their subjects and focused on landscapes and everyday urban scenes. Like many subsequent avant-garde movements, it derived its name from a derisive label applied in a negative review. The 1874 Paris exhibition that introduced the group to the public contained Monet's 1872 painting _Impression: Sunrise_, leading the critic Louis Leroy to coin the mocking term Impressionism, which the group co-opted. In the years following, Impressionism spread beyond France, most notably to Great Britain and the United States.</p>

Expressionist art was often characterized by spontaneous brushwork or mark-making, distorted figures, a progression towards abstraction, and a concentration on forms and ideas borrowed from myths and so-called “primitive art.” In reaction to the shock of urbanization and the machine age, many of these artists attempted to convey psychological states of isolation and alienation, or sought refuge in the idea of a spiritual art. In Vienna, Egon Schiele created unsettling, sinuous portraits that evoked the anxiety of the age; in Germany, the formal experiments of Wassily Kandinsky combined new forms and color combinations with a focus on mysticism and expression; and in the field of architecture, Bruno Taut translated the utopian ideals of the tendency into fantastic buildings.</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">Cubism was the most important movement of the 20th century and marked the birth of abstract art. Invented and pursued by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in Paris between 1907 and 1914 and inspired by the simplified landscapes of Paul Cézanne, Cubism took the revolutionary step of rejecting the 500-year-old idea that a painting was like a window, thus ruled by perspective. Instead, Picasso and Braque created more conceptual, subjective paintings that sought to represent the underlying structure of existence. The best-known Cubist works look like shattered glass in dim browns and yellows, and are composed of various sharp planes that combine to form people or objects. Cubism took its name from an insult delivered by the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who commented that one of Braque’s paintings looked as if it were “full of little cubes.” After 1910, Picasso and Braque’s Cubism was quickly adopted by many other artists in Paris and beyond and ended up being the primary influence on most or all abstract art before the outbreak of World War II.</p>

While best known for a dynamic style in painting and sculpture that captured speed and movement as if in time-lapse, Futurist artists created “total works of art” (performance, installation, fashion, and more). Though many leading Futurists died in World War I, a “second Futurism” followed, which allied itself with the fascist politics of Mussolini.</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">While abstraction is evident around the world in art and functional objects, its art-historical significance is as a category for 20th-century Western art that moved away from the faithful representation of nature. The origins of abstraction are commonly located in the works of J.M.W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, the Impressionists, as well as in the early 1900s, when Paul Cézanne's stylized, flattened forms influenced what would eventually be called the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Arguably the first abstract art movement, Cubism would prove foundational to countless branches of abstract art, including Futurism in Italy, the non-objective abstraction of Wassily Kandinsky, Kasimir Malevich, and Piet Mondrian, and the Purism of Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant. Though the intervening decades have seen returns to representation in different movements, virtually all of the dominant art forms of the latter half of the 20th century—including Abstract Expressionism, Neo-Dada, Pop Art, Minimalism, and Conceptual Art—have embraced the power and aesthetic of formal abstraction in lieu of literal representation.</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">A movement originating in Zurich in 1916 as a reaction both to the chaos of Western society in the wake of World War I and to bourgeois society, which was seen as having produced the war. It is characterized by the rejection of old forms of artmaking in favor of an anti-art that asserts art’s irrelevance and explores new forms of creation. Dadaists are usually divided into two camps: those creating from anger and frustration and those embracing the absurd. Prominent adherents include Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp, both of whom sought in their work to destabilize artistic dogmas, particularly traditional formal strategies and concepts of artistic meaning. From Zurich, Dada spread across Europe—most notably the German cities of Berlin, Cologne, and Hannover—and eventually into the United States, particularly New York City. Its emphasis on the bizarre had a major influence on Surrealism, founded in 1924.</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">A term coined in 1927 by MoMA’s first director Alfred H. Barr Jr. to describe American artists of the 1920s who depicted American architecture, industry, and landscapes in highly precise but simplified lines and forms. Although influenced by Cubism and its various European offshoots (such as Futurism and Purism), the Precisionists were distinctly American in their focus on regional imagery like skyscrapers, suspension bridges, and mills. Some of the best-known artists understood as Precisionist are Charles Sheeler, Charles Demuth, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Historically, the Precisionists' emphasis on American building projects and industry has been seen as a reflection of 1920s and ‘30s American isolationism and consequently, the country’s desire to define its unique national identity.</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">A movement embracing the irrational as a means of creating art and experiencing life, whose founding document is the Surrealist Manifesto composed by André Breton in 1924. Taking pure psychic automatism as the ideal state of man, Surrealists believed that one could express the true functioning of thought in the unconscious. Initially, the most important aspect of the unconscious was desire, which they felt was central to humanity—the authentic voice of the inner self and the key to understanding human beings. Dreams, childhood, madness, non-Western art, and chance situations became central to discovering the irrational in Surrealist art.</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">Used since the 1960s to refer to a highly decorative style of design, characterized by streamlined geometric forms and bright colors, that was influential in Europe and the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. With roots in Art Nouveau, it was originally promoted by the 1925 Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, but one could also argue that it emerged from such 20th-century avant-garde movements as Cubism, Fauvism, and Constructivism.</p>

              <img class="art-movement-image" src="">
              <p class="art-movement-description">Pop Art was the dominant movement in early 1960s American art. Short for “popular art,” it featured common household objects and consumer products like Coca-Cola and Campbell’s Soup cans, as well as forms of media—such as comics, newspapers, and magazines—recognizable to the masses. Artists often created Pop works using mechanical or commercial techniques, such as silk-screening. As Warhol suggested, the choice of mundane subject matter and machine-like techniques was a blunt rejection of the heroic subjects and methods of Abstract Expressionism, the leading American movement of the 1950s. Not often discussed is the fact that Pop Art originated in England and paralleled similar movements in France and Germany. Pop Art was incredibly diverse, especially in its international variants, which included Nouveau Réalisme in France, Capitalist Realism in Germany, and Anti-Art in Japan.</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">One of the most important and influential art styles of the 1960s, Minimalism identifies works of art most often comprised of geometric shapes in simple arrangements and lacking any decorative or dynamic flourishes. These geometric shapes characterized the elemental or “bare bones” forms of art, which, according to critics, represented the culmination of modern art's progression toward the most simplified form of abstract art possible. Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, and Carl Andre are among the best-known artists associated with Minimalism, which is characteristically associated with sculpture rather than painting. Minimalism’s roots arguably lie in Russian Constructivism, the paintings of postwar American artists such as Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, and Frank Stella, and the formalist theories of Clement Greenberg. Initial labels for Minimalism—none of which became popular—were "ABC Art" and "Primary Structures" (the latter was the title of one of the first organized exhibitions of Minimalist works).</p>

              <p class="art-movement-description">Though it has come to refer generally to painting that emulates the look of photographs, typically with hyperrealistic clarity, the term "photorealistic" traces its roots to Photorealism, the American art movement of the 1960s and ’70s. An outgrowth of Pop Art, Photorealism is most closely associated with artists who replicate the highly-focused look of well-composed, sharply-focused photographs, such as Chuck Close, Richard Estes, and Malcolm Morley. However, in Europe, artists like Gerhard Richter and Franz Gertsch have likewise been referred to as photorealists, but for a different reason: the hazy quality and unexpected angles in their candid portraits resemble casual, often blurred snapshots. Today, artists who emulate the look of photographs make work in both ways (and in between), and as a result, push the boundaries of what constitutes a photorealistic image. Is it the crisp, extreme focus of a well-lit photograph, or the imitation of poor, faded, or murky photographic scenes?</p>

              <img class="art-movement-image" src="">
              <p class="art-movement-description">A shortening of the phrase "landscape art,” used interchangeably with Earthworks to refer to pieces made of materials derived from the earth or situated on or within a landscape. Such works are usually site specific—created for and utilizing aspects or characteristics of a particular location. Both American and European artists began to use dirt, rocks, and sand as media and subject matter in the late 1960s, experimenting with diverse approaches. In 1967 the English artist Richard Long walked up and down a stretch of meadow over and over, creating a visible path depicted in the photograph A Line Made by Walking. This understated meditation on the symmetry and grace of a simple landscape contrasts with Land Art works that seek to dramatically alter a site, such as Robert Smithson’s well-known 1970 sculpture and film, Spiral Jetty, which uses 7,000 tons of basalt, boulders, mud, and salt crystals mined from the area around Rozel Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, to form a massive spiral winding 450 meters from the lake shore. Some of these works address ecological issues like those concerning activists in the 1960s. Alan Sonfist’s Time Landscape, for instance, which he proposed in 1965 and implemented in 1978, re-creates the original landscape on a small plot in Manhattan, calling attention to what is lost through urbanization and development.</p>
